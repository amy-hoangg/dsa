# Data Structure and Algorithm Project

GUI of the project


In this programming assignment focused on ScholarNet, a social network for affiliations, students engage with implementing data structures and algorithms. The primary objective is to develop a program facilitating the input and search functionalities for affiliation-related information and their interlinked publications. Within this assignment, some operations are compulsory while others remain optional. The compulsory tasks are fundamental for passing, while implementing optional parts positively impacts the grade.

The core task involves implementing a designated class responsible for storing necessary data using its data structures, with methods designed to execute the required functionalities. Although the main program and a Qt-based graphical interface are provided, the assignment also allows running the program in a text-only mode without Qt libraries.

Two primary goals drive this assignment. Firstly, it aims to foster proficiency in utilizing pre-existing data structures and algorithms available in the STL (Standard Template Library). Secondly, it encourages students to develop their efficient algorithms while gauging their performance. However, leveraging ready-made algorithms from the STL when suitable is advisable.

Efficiency is a key aspect, quantified by command counts. Each operation's weight influences the performance estimate, detailed within the Perfestimate grader in Plussa. While striving for efficiency, it's acknowledged that achieving optimal speed for all functions concurrently might be impractical. Minor optimizations, such as choosing between 'a = a + b' or 'a += b', won't significantly affect the final grade.

Key points for consideration include:
- The main program is operable with or without a graphical interface, ensuring uniformity in functionality.
- Performance targets aim for operations to perform better than nlog(n) on average. Achieving faster performances, often even linear, is preferred.
- A detailed analysis of the asymptotic performance (O-notation) for each implemented operation, along with a brief rationale, is expected.
- Command counts' sensitivity to data size (N) during performance tests is crucial for evaluation. Comparisons with reference implementations are available but don't solely determine grades.
- Grading occurs post-deadline, assessing functional and non-crashing code. Final grading is based on the overall distribution of results, favoring better performance.
- Command counts encompass all work during an operation. Higher performance correlates with better grades.
- Inadequate fulfillment of pass criteria leads to assignment rejection, while multiple submissions with feedback-driven improvements are encouraged.
